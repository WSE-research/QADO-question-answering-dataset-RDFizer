# question-answering-dataset-RDFizer

This tool provides a webservice to convert structured data into RDF.

## Setup service

### Using Gradle

To run the service locally run `./gradlew run`. 

### Using Docker

Otherwise, you can set up a Docker image running the service by executing the folllowing command:

```bash
docker build -t rdfizer:latest .
```

To start a Docker container use the following command:

```shell
docker run -d -p "$EXTERNAL_PORT:8080" rdfizer:latest
```

## Accessing the service

To transform a JSON file to RDF perform a `POST`-Request at `$HOST:$PORT/json2rdf` with a JSON
payload of the following structure:

```json
{
  "format": "Mapping file name",
  "label": "Name for the generated RDF triples",
  "filePath": "URL of the JSON file",
  "homepage": "URL of the data publisher"
}
```

By default, the following formats are supported:

* https://github.com/ag-sc/QALD[QALD], supported versions 5, 6, 8, and 9  (`qald`) 
* https://github.com/AskNowQA/LC-QuAD[LC-QuAD], supported version 1 (`lc-quad`) and 2 (`lc-quad-2`)
* https://github.com/vladislavneon/RuBQ[RuBQ], supported versions 1 and 2 (`rubq`)
* https://www.tau-nlp.sites.tau.ac.il/compwebq[CWQ] (`cwq`)

The follow cURL command can be used to convert a JSON file of the QALD benchmark
into RDF.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://$HOST:$PORT/json2rdf' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "filePath": "https://github.com/ag-sc/QALD/raw/master/6/data/qald-6-train-multilingual-raw.json",
    "format": "qald",
    "label": "QALD 6 train multilingual raw",
    "homepage": "https://github.com/ag-sc/QALD"
}'
```

## Adding additional formats

To add new mapping rules just add a new mapping file `NAME.ttl` to `app/mappings` while `NAME` has to be in all caps. 
The mapping language is https://rml.io/specs/rml/[RML]. 
To use the file within the webservice just use the base file name as the `format` parameter.
