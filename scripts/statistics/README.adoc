# SPARQL dataset statistics

This sub-project address the need of a good understanding of the characteristics of Knowledge Graph Question Answering benchmark datasets.
For this purpose, a tool is provided here to create a Google Spreadsheet with statistics from a triplestore, currently the [Stardog triplestore](https://www.stardog.com/) is supported.
**Python 3.8** or newer is required for the current implementation.
To install all required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
Run `python createSpreadsheet.py` to generate your statistics. 
In your Google Drive, a new subdirectory `SPARQL Statistics CURRENT_DATE`.
In this directory, a spreadsheet file and optional violin plots are stored reflecting the collected statistics from your dataset.

## Configuration

### Google Cloud Console

To use the tool, it is required to configure a Google Cloud Console project. 
You can use the preconfigured credentials, but therefore it is currently necessary to ask the the maintainers of this project to grant access. 
Hence, it is recommended, to [create your own Google Cloud Console project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/get-started?hl=en) and replace the `credentials.json` with your private setup. 
The tool needs read-and-write-permissions for the *Google Sheets API* and the *Google Drive API*.

### Script configuration

You might edit the `config.py` to select your triplestore and configure the display size of the violin plots in your spreadsheet.

### Statistics

Create your SPARQL queries and store them into the `queries` directory. 
The tool creates a new worksheet for each SPARQL query file.

#### Boxplot data

If you want to generate a boxplot, you need to store your query with the file ending `_boxplot.sparql`. 
Additionally, the data for the boxplot needs to be selected via `(GROUP_CONCAT(?YOUR_VARIABLE ; SEPARATOR = ",") AS ?concat)`.
The tool also generates a violin plot and inserts it in the `Violin charts` worksheet.
This plot is stored locally inside the `images` directory and uploaded to Google Drive.

**Attention!** The violin plots are configured to grant read-only access via a share link by default.

### Charts

Adding charts is possible by creating an [EmbeddedChart JSON object](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/charts#embeddedchart) and storing it inside the `charts` folder. You can create multiple charts per worksheet.

## Default statistics

The tool generates per default the following statistics for RDFized QA benchmarks:

* Query length per benchmark
* Query modifiers per benchmark
* Question length per 
  - answer type and benchmark (boxplot)
  - benchmark (boxplot)
  - language and benchmark (boxplot)
* Questions per 
  - answer type
  - benchmark
  - language
  - language and benchmark
* Question type per benchmark
* Statistics of used resources inside the SPARQL queries per benchmark
